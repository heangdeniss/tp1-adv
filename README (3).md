# 📚 Main Topics I Expect to Study

## 1. Python Review

Before moving to advanced topics, I need to be comfortable with:

- Variables
- Data types
- Lists
- Tuples
- Dictionaries
- Sets
- Conditions
- Loops
- Functions
- Input and output

Example:

```python
def average(values):
    return sum(values) / len(values)

scores = [70, 80, 90]
print(average(scores))
```

Output:

```text
80.0
```

---

## 2. Advanced Python

Topics may include:

- List comprehensions
- Dictionary comprehensions
- Lambda functions
- Iterators
- Generators
- Decorators
- Modules
- Packages
- Context managers

My goal is to understand not only **how** these features work, but also **when** they are useful.

---

## 3. Object-Oriented Programming

Important concepts:

```text
Class
Object
Attribute
Method
Constructor
Encapsulation
Inheritance
Polymorphism
```

Example:

```python
class Student:
    def __init__(self, name, score):
        self.name = name
        self.score = score

    def show_result(self):
        print(f"{self.name}: {self.score}")


student = Student("Student A", 85)
student.show_result()
```

---

## 4. Functions, Modules, and Reusable Code

I want to avoid putting everything inside one large Python file.

Instead of:

```text
main.py
```

I should be able to organize a project like this:

```text
project/
│
├── main.py
├── data_loader.py
├── preprocessing.py
├── analysis.py
├── model.py
└── utils.py
```

This makes the project easier to understand and maintain.

---

## 5. File Handling

I will practice working with files such as:

- `.txt`
- `.csv`
- `.json`
- `.xlsx`

Example:

```python
with open("notes.txt", "r") as file:
    text = file.read()

print(text)
```

---

## 6. Exception Handling

Programs should be able to handle errors safely.

Important keywords:

```text
try
except
else
finally
raise
```

Example:

```python
try:
    value = int(input("Enter a number: "))
    print(100 / value)

except ValueError:
    print("Please enter a valid integer.")

except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("The number cannot be zero.")
```

---

# 🔢 NumPy

NumPy is important for numerical computing.

Topics I want to practice:

- Arrays
- Dimensions
- Shape
- Indexing
- Slicing
- Broadcasting
- Vector operations
- Matrix operations
- Statistical functions

Example:

```python
import numpy as np

values = np.array([5, 10, 15, 20])

print(np.mean(values))
print(np.max(values))
```

---

# 🐼 Pandas

Pandas is one of the main tools for working with structured data.

Topics:

- Series
- DataFrame
- Reading CSV files
- Selecting columns
- Filtering rows
- Missing values
- Sorting
- GroupBy
- Merge
- Join
- Aggregation

Example:

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")

print(df.head())
print(df.info())
print(df.describe())
```

---

# 🧹 Data Cleaning

A typical cleaning process may look like this:

```text
Raw Data
   ↓
Understand the Data
   ↓
Check Missing Values
   ↓
Remove Duplicates
   ↓
Fix Data Types
   ↓
Handle Outliers
   ↓
Clean Text / Categories
   ↓
Final Clean Dataset
```

Important tasks:

- Missing values
- Duplicate rows
- Wrong data types
- Outliers
- String cleaning
- Date conversion
- Category formatting

---

# 📊 Data Visualization

I will practice using tools such as:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
```

Common visualizations:

- Line chart
- Bar chart
- Histogram
- Scatter plot
- Box plot

Before creating a graph, I should ask:

1. What question am I trying to answer?
2. Which variables do I need?
3. Which chart makes the result easiest to understand?

---

# 🐞 Debugging

When my program has an error, I should not immediately rewrite everything.

My debugging workflow:

```text
Read the error message
        ↓
Locate the problem
        ↓
Understand the error type
        ↓
Check variable values
        ↓
Fix one small part
        ↓
Run the program again
```

Common Python errors:

- `SyntaxError`
- `TypeError`
- `ValueError`
- `IndexError`
- `KeyError`
- `NameError`
- `FileNotFoundError`

---

# 🧪 Testing

Testing helps confirm that my code behaves correctly.

Example:

```python
def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b

assert multiply(2, 3) == 6
assert multiply(5, 4) == 20
```

I want to build the habit of testing code instead of only checking whether it runs once.

---

# ⚡ Code Performance

A correct solution is good, but I also want to understand whether it is efficient.

Things to compare:

- Execution time
- Memory usage
- Number of operations
- Code readability

Important concepts:

```text
Time Complexity
Space Complexity
Big O Notation
```

Common complexities:

```text
O(1)
O(log n)
O(n)
O(n log n)
O(n²)
```

---

# 🔄 Data Science Programming Workflow

A simple workflow I can follow is:

```text
Define Problem
      ↓
Collect / Receive Data
      ↓
Load Data
      ↓
Explore Data
      ↓
Clean Data
      ↓
Transform Data
      ↓
Analyze Data
      ↓
Visualize Results
      ↓
Build Model if Needed
      ↓
Evaluate
      ↓
Explain Results
```

Programming supports every step of this workflow.

# 🏠 Homework

For homework, I want to keep both my answer and my mistakes.

```text
Homework:
Date:
Topic:
Question:
My First Answer:
Correct Answer:
My Mistake:
What I Learned:
```

Mistakes are useful because they show me what I still need to review.

---

# 🧠 My Study Method

For each new topic:

```text
1. Read the concept
2. Understand the idea
3. Look at a simple example
4. Write the code myself
5. Run it
6. Change the example
7. Create an error
8. Fix the error
9. Explain the code in my own words
10. Practice again
```

A topic is not fully learned just because the code runs.

I should be able to explain:

- What it does
- Why it works
- When to use it
- What can go wrong

# 🚀 Final Goal

By the end of **Advanced Programming for Data Science**, I want to be able to take a real data problem and build a complete programming solution from beginning to end.

My target workflow is:

```text
Understand the Problem
        ↓
Organize the Project
        ↓
Write Clean Python Code
        ↓
Process the Data
        ↓
Analyze the Data
        ↓
Test and Debug
        ↓
Improve the Solution
        ↓
Explain the Result Clearly
```

> My final goal is not only to make the code work, but to understand the code well enough to build, improve, debug, and explain it independently.
